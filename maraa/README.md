To install Gmail Snooze from code:

 * Replace the sample code in the text editor with the contents of "Code.gs"
 * Use the File > Save menu and name the script (e.g. "Gmail Snooze")
 * Use the File > New > Html file menu and create a file called "ui"
 * Replace the sample code in the text editor with the contents of "ui.html"
 * Use the Publish > Deploy as Web App menu
 * Click "Save new version" (no need for any text in the box)
 * Change "Execute the app as" to "User accessing the web app"
 * OPTIONAL: If you want to allow piggybacking, change "Who has access to the
   app" to "Anyone". Allowing piggybacking does not give anyone else access to
   your Gmail or scripts.
 * Click Deploy
 * Navigate to the "Current web app URL"
 * Follow the piggyback installation instructions below.

UNINSTALL
---------
You can temporarily uninstall using the Uninstall button at the web app URL.
This will functionally disable Gmail Snooze but preserve all of your options
for reinstalling later. If you would like to fully uninstall Gmail Snooze,
there is a link in the automated email you will receive from Apps Script
at installation time. If you did a code installation you can also delete
the project.
